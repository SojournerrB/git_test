Hello world! I am sitting in my living room, learning this and watching the television.
The weather today is cold, drab, and grey. Rain earlier.
Drinking coffee, as well. Adelle is at work.
Krobus and Sumi are hanging out here as well. Krobus on the tree, and Sumi is probably under a bed somewhere.
